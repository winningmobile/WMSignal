/** 
 *
 * CallState exposes the state of a single call, in a simplified way intended to be consumed by the user interface code.
 *
 * The observable value observableProgress exposes values of type CallProgression that indicate the progression of the call, from connecting through teminated.
 * The future futureTermination will eventually contain a CallTermination that indicates how the call terminated.
 * The future futureShortAuthenticationString will eventually contain the sas to display, or else a failure if the call fails beforehand.
 * The remoteNumber field is what it sounds like.
 * The initiatedLocally field determines if we are the initiator of the call or the responder to a call.
 *
 * The futures exposed by this type are guaranteed to run callbacks (from then/catch/finally/etc) either inline or on the main thread.
